Notes from the Machine Learning course held by Professor Alessio Micheli at University of Pisa 2019-2020 written by Alessandro Cudazzo and Giulia Volpi.

These notes are intended only as support for the study of the subject and as slides side notes. They do not cover the whole program but only a part, to compensate for the missing parts, we recommend the use of slides and books provided by Prof. Micheli.
